This app organizes locations by saving them as *pins* within *bags*. Users can create as many bags as they want and place in them as many pins as they want. Every pin is associated with only one bag; pins can also be moved between bags.

##Features
- Permanently save locations as pins for later reference.
- Add a description along with location pins.
- Group location pins into bags.
- Add locations by tapping on the map or entering GPS coordinates.
- Compute a route through all of your saved locations in a bag.
- Swipe left on a pin’s name to move it to another bag or delete it.
- Export your saved locations to a CSV file, which can be saved on Dropbox, sent with iMessage, emailed and more.
